If you had access to ``epyc`` you also have access to Middle Earth. If you need access contact mjuric@uw.edu with your UW NetID.

Basic Jupyterhub and shell access are as follows:

* `Arnor Juptyerhub <https://arnor.astro.washington.edu/jupyter>`_
* `Gondor Jupyterhub <https://gondor.astro.washington.edu/jupyter>`_
* Arnor SSH: ``ssh <NetID>@arnor.astro.washington.edu``
* Gondor SSH: ``ssh <NetID>@gondor.astro.washington.edu``

Communication about system status is in the `#computing <https://uw-dirac.slack.com/archives/C8WRK67LY>`_ channel on the 
`DiRAC Slack workspace <https://uw-dirac.slack.com/>`_.
