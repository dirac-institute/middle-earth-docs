Requesting access to Middle Earth
#################################

UW Net IDs are a prerequisite for most forms of access to DiRAC infrastructure.  NetIDs are issued to `students and staff affiliated with UW https://admit.washington.edu/uw-netid/`__. External collaborators need a sponsored NetID in order to access any University of Washington system.

External collaborators must have a sponsoring professor or staff member, who must get their NetID through the `Sponsored NetID process with a professor https://uwconnect.uw.edu/it?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0033933`__.

-----------
User groups
-----------

You may request membership for several user groups. All user groups have the same access to the compute resources, but different user groups have different permissions to access certain data.
    * `astro` - the default user group for all UW NetIDs associated with the Astronomy Department.
    * `astro-dirac` - the user group that has permission to access Middle-Earth resources (Arnor, Gondor, JupyterHub etc.)
    * `rubin-users` - the users that have the permission to access embargoed Rubin data.

 To request to be associated with the `astro-dirac` user group see `Requesting access to Middle Earth`__ and to be associated with the `rubin-users` user group see `Requesting Rubin Data Access at UW`__

---------------------------------
Requesting access to Middle Earth
---------------------------------

Ensure you have the pre-requisites:
* UW NetID

Process:
* send an email requesting access to Middle Earth compute resources to `help-astro@uw.edu <mailto:help-astro@uw.edu>`
* include your UW NetID
* include the the sponsoring faculty/staff member
* include `mjuric@uw.edu <mailto:mjuric@uw.edu>`
* include your relationship with the department (undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, external)
* describe, shortly, how you are connected to the department or a project
* request to be added to the `astro-dirac` group
* request the default shell (`bash`, `zsh` etc.) to be associated with your user (default is `tcsh`)

An example template email may look like:

```
Hello,

I am Glaurung, The Great Worm. My UW NetID is `GlaurungTheGreat`.
I am a postdoctoral researcher working on World Domination with my advisor Morgoth Bauglir (cc'd in the email) and I would like to get access to Middle Earth compute resources.

Can you help me by adding me to the `astro-dirac` user group?
Can I have `bash` as my default shell?
Thanks!

Regards,
G.
```

Well formed requests with valid UW NetIDs are effectively auto-approved pending verification of the account.

* have completed associated SLAC training videos
* be listed in `SITCOM-50 https://sitcomtn-050.lsst.io/`__ or equivalent document

Process:

Hello,

I am Glaurung, The Great Worm, My UW NetID and SLAC S3DF username is `GlaurungTheGreat`.
I am a researcher working on causing a Mass Extinction Event with the Solar System Group under Morgoth Bauglir (cc'd in the email).
Can I get access to Rubin Data access on Middle Earth? Andrew Connolly (cc'd) can confirm I am listed in SITCOM-50 and have permissions to access Rubin embargoed data.
Thanks!

Regards,
G.
```

Once approved by Andrew Connolly you will be given access to Rubin data.
